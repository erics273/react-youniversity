This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

For future projects I will consider using the [TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter). 

## TODO
* Implement AuthService for session management
* Implement Service for YOUniversity API
* Add CRUD Functionality for Students and Majors
* Incorporate testing component into the project
* Implement server side rendering with JAVA application
