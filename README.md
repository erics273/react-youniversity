This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

For future projects I will consider using the [TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter). 

I would also consider taking out react-bootstrap for [Material-UI](https://material-ui-next.com/). I am also open to some manual styling and understanding more about [Material Design](https://material.io/)
